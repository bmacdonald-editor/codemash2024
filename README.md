# codemash2024
Repository for slides from CodeMash 2024.
I had two talks at CodeMash this year:
* "Verbs, Not Nouns: Writing Documentation that Users Want to Read"
* "Networking for Introverts: Build, Maintain, and Use Networks Without Being Creepy"

This repo contains the slide decks for both talks, in PDF format. Speaker notes not included.
